                                    This past Saturday, December 17th, we attended the bunny bots competition held at Catlin Gabel School in Portland. We brought three robots in total, two of which (A and B) were designed and built by new students. The third robot (robot C) was our experimental swerve drive base that we decorated with Christmas lights and a wreath.                                </p>
                                <p className="lead">
                                    At the competition, robot A ranked 19th and B ranked 22nd after the qualifying rounds. Robot 3 (the swerve drive base) placed 3rd after qualifying rounds and advanced into the semifinals as the 3rd alliance captain!

                                October 15th weâ€™ll be competing in Girls Generation, an offseason competition that highlights women in STEM! It gives people a chance to experience STEM in a more comfortable environment, and we are excited to be involved! We just successfully completed a new type of drive base called swerve which allows the robot to drive in any direction. We are also bringing our robot from the past season in order to give more opportunities for driving, coaching, and competition setting experience. Girls Generation has been a great way for incoming and current team members to learn manufacturing, electrical, software, and experience the team environment! Now that the robot drives we need to finish attaching the climb mechanism and then practice for the upcoming competition!
