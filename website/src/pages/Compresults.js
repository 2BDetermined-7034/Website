                                    On December 17th, 2022 we attended a bunny bots completion held at Catlin Gable school campus in portland, bringing three robots total, two of which were designed and made by new/incoming students, and the third robot was a swerve drive base - previously made for our Girls Generation Competition, but we just stripped it down to just the drive base, removing anything that was not needed, and added weights, Christmas lights, and a wreath.
                                </p>

                                    During that time, Robots named A and B (the ones made by new members), with A placing 19th place and B placing 22nd place out of 24 teams after qualifying rounds and both were not picked during alliance selections and did not continue forward. Robot C/3 (the swerve drive base) placed 3rd after qualifying rounds, and moved onto semifinals, where they lost the first round of the semifinals, as well as the second round, and did not continue forward.
